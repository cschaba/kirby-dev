* Kirby-CMS Development Environment

This is my *personal* setup to create new websites and for developing plugins (later, not now ready).

Here you can find the original [[https://getkirby.com][Kirby-CMS]]

NO WARRANTY, NO SUPPORT, NO NOTHING YET!

** Getting started

Requirements:
- Macbook or something similar
- Docker or something similar

Steps:
1. Run ~docker compose build~ to create the image
2. Run ~docker compose up -d~ to run the container

The apache2 logfiles are printed to the docker logs. Use  ~docker compose logs -f~ to "tail -f" the output.

Open the website with http://localhost and access the panel via http://localhost/panel
